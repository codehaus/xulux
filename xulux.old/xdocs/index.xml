<section name="Introduction to XULUX">

<p>
  The XULUX project was started to scratch an itch (a big itch)
  The itch we have is that it is a pain to create gui's and it 
  takes too much development time, while we can better use
  invest our time in doing usefull things, like focussing on 
  business logic.
