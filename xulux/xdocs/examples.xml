       There are no examples yet! This is just an idea that has not been implemented
       yet. You can find some basic examples in the <code>src/uitest</code> that contain
       some of the widgets that are present in Xulux. <br/>
       We need lot's of improvement in this area though. If you want a specific use case
       or example, please don't hestitate to mail us with your wishes or add a request in
       the bug database Jira.

    The hard part of systems like this is to decide if this system is useable to you.
    To make the decision easier, I provide some examples of current scenarios that
    are supported.

  <p>
    If you can think of any usefull examples that can be added, please let us know!

    NYX needs maven to be build. Since I assume you already have maven,
    this is an example which should run without any trouble.
    Maven uses a project.xml file, that is being
    processed by <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt">Betwixt</a>
    into useable objects. 
    From this NYX will automatically create a dictionary and a gui, which lets you edit
    the project.xml (currently limited, since no support for tables is present yet)
    and save the xml again. The saving is not done by nyx (it doesn't want to now about that)
    , but by a rule which materializes the bean back into the xml via 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt">Betwixt</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can start the example by typing <b>maven examples:maven</b>
