<section name="Introduction to NYX">
<p>
  NYX provides an easy way to display dynamicaly 
  generated Swing components, driven by data.
  The main focus will be creation forms and tables, which
  are the components most widely used in data driven applications.
  The main goal is to get rid of the horrible code that forms and
  tables seems to be producing and to completely seperate
  data, view and business logic. You can learn a bit more about this 
  on the <a href="features.html">features</a> page.

<section name="What's up with the name??">
  <p>
  My main goal (not in life btw ;) is to get xulux up and running, 
  but I just haven't found the time yet to make time available
  to make the "perfect" solution, I started to solve some immediate 
  problems. Since the project could be usefull for the xulux project 
  in terms of learning experience (at least for me), it just isn't 
  xulux yet. To not mess up a project with higher goals, my opinion
  is that it also doesn't belong at that codebase.
  So there was the name <b>Not Yet Xulux</b>, in short <b>NYX</b>.<br/>
  NYX, pronounced with a dutch tongue in Holland, actually translates
  to the enlgish word <b>nothing</b> (which I hope this will not end up 
  as that ;)).
  According to the website <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Nyx.html" target="new">Greek Methology Link</a> Nyx is this :
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Nyx is Night, a powerful goddess whose dark light falls from the stars, and who dictates not only to men but also to gods. Even Zeus does not wish to upset Night</b>
  </p>
  <p> 
    Very appropiate I must say ;) I refrain myself from explenation of this
    appropiate statement for now ;)
