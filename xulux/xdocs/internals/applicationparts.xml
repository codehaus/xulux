    You can set the size and the position of the widget
    via xml or programmatically. The default layout for swing
    that is used is the XYLayout. This is mostly used for eg
    business applications that have to run on a specific client
    (only tested under win32 btw).
    In ApplicationPart in the method activate() the widget is 
    added to a swing JPanel and this will call the XYLayout 
    manager. So size and position are only set on initial 
    activation and are never refreshed. Setting sizes will not
    come to a refresh of the widget, but when setting the gui
    calls the layoutmanager again, it will layout it according
    to the size being set.
