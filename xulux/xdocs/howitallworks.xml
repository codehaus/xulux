<section name="How NYX currently works">
  <p>
    Not everything currently works the way I have in mind. See the features page, 
    if you want to learn more about the goals. 
  </p>
    <subsection name="Core">
      <p>
        The core of the nyx system, only contains non gui layers specific code. 
        (don't let the gui package fool you).
        The core is devided into a couple of part :
        - the context.
        - global
        - gui
        - guidefaults
        - rules
        - utility classes
        - NyxRunner
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Swing">
      <p>
        This swing gui layer is currently provided as part of the core nyx jar.
        In a later stage this will be moved to a seperate jar. 
        A lot of the swing stuff is already documented. Internals are not yet important
        to document, so I will do that when there is need for it. 
        Expect changes in this area, so we can make more use of generics, so all gui layers
        can be based on the same api and rely on the same mechanismes. See gui for more info
        on this.
