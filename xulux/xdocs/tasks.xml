        The following is a list of items that need to be completed in
        the TOCURE version of nyx. This version will be obsoleted
        as soon as the head version is stable and finished. Parts
        of the todo list can be ported to the latest version.

          Create documention.<br/>
          Especially there is a request for a best practice document
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a focusmanager type and add a nyxdefaults xml file
          (don't confuse that with guidefaults.xml!),
          so people can map the type to a different class (or
          add a class attribute so they an override per window), so
          people can create their own focus manager. 
          We need to interface the focusmanager to something generic
          and depending on the ui platform chosen use that implementation
