<section name="Features">
  <p>
    This page will describe the features that NYX will have.
    None of the features are in a ready state at the moment, since
    we are in a big refactor of the core to seperate out all 
    components that should be pluggable.
    The main features of nyx as stated on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>
    will be explained a bit more in detail.
    
    <subsection name="Core">
      <p>
        The core of the nyx system should mainly contain interfaces
        and a some logic to glue the interfaces together into a working
        system. Still a lot of work to be done in this area, but most
        changes will not hurt existing systems.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Gui Layers">
      <p>
        For now we only have a swing implementation, which is not yet 
        finalized. SWT, AWT and html/servlets are next on the list
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Widgets">
      <p>
        List of widgets
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Data Providers">
      <p>
        For now you need to provide data yourself and the dataproviders
        are not interfaced and pluggable yet.
        All data can be defined in the dictionary (baseType is the most 
        important one) and strange getters and setters can be specified in 
        the dictionary too.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Rule Engines">
      <p>
        For now only the internal nyx rule engine is used. 
        We are looking at other rule engines when there is a release
        of nyx that is usefull for the public.
