  <p>
    This page will describe the features that NYX will have.
    None of the features are in a ready state at the moment, since
    we are in a big refactor of the core to seperate out all 
    components that should be pluggable.
    The main features of nyx as stated on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>
    will be explained a bit more in detail.
