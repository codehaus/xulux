    Nyx can be modified using vm properties. This is a list
    of the currently supported properties.
  </p>
  <subsection name="xulux.swing.imageloader">
    <p>
      This property will set the imageloader to be used.
      It defaults to looking for jimi in the classpath, Setting the property 
      manually always overrides the default property. The class to load images via JIMI is 
      org.xulux.nyx.gui.swing.util.JimiImageLoader. If jimi is not on 
      your classpath or the specified imageloader is not on the classpath
      (or has problems instantiating) then it will fallback to standard
      swing ImageIcon.getImage() for image loading. It will give feedback
      on the level warning that the custom imageloader could not be loaded
      and if images used in the application couldn't be loaded by the swing
      ImageIcon class, since they are icompatible. 
      It is advized to add jimi to your classpath if you want to use .ico files
    </p>
    <p>
      You can write your own imageLoader by implementing the 
      <code>org.xulux.swing.util.ImageLoaderInterface</code> interface.
      It is a very simple api. If you have written a custom one, don't hasitate to send
      us a patch.
