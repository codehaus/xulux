  <p>
    XULUX by default, comes with its own gui driver. This xml format
    has been thought up based on the needs that I had when developing
    it. The format is pretty straightforward and doesn't add any
    dependencies to xulux than just a SAXParser, that already is present
    on most platforms on which xulux should run. 
  </p>

<section name="How to use">
  <p>
   The <a href="../apidocs/org/xulux/core/pplicationPartHandler.html">
   XuluxHandler</a> is the parser to create 
   <a href="../apidocs/org\xulux\nyx\context\ApplicationPart.html">XuluxParts</a>
   from xml. You can just call the handler with an inpustream to get a part
   back to be used in an application. The part you get back, just needs
   a call to <code>part.activate()</code> to show the gui and do it's magic.
   So a part can be processed from your current with these lines of code
   <source>
        // for now mandatory, sorry :(
        XuluxContext.getInstance();
        String xml = "org/xulux/screens/person.xml";
        Object object = new PersonBean();
        InputStream stream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(xml);
        XuluxPart part = new XuluxPartHandler().read(stream, object);
        part.activate();
   </source>
   This piece of sourcecode gets the screen xml from the classloader,
   creates a bean to store the data and parses the screen xml, which returns
   a part. Just call part.activate and the screen will be shown to the user
   and can edit the person data.
   If you specify the class used by the part, you can also not pass in a bean
   , in which case xulux will create such an object for you.
   <p>
     <b>Note : </b> The parsing will change in the near future, since in the future
     there will be a mapping associated with the form, which will handle the data
     part.
