  <p>
   Since you can create your own gui drivers, a simple howto will
   provide you with the necessary information to create one yourself,
   or to adapt a format that already exists.
   For now the drivers are very simple to create :
   <b>Just write a handler (you can choose your own format) and use
   it to generate xulux parts and let it create widgets</b>
   <b><i>In a later stage there will be some kind of api
   to be able to customize the way the gui behaves. Eg some
   formats don't support the rule systems that we support.
   We will come to this specification during development of the
   XUL driver</i></b>
