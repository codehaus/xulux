    Although the name of the project is XULUX and one of the goals
    was to make a XUL Gui Driver, there is not any work on the way
    to have that implemented yet. This will be started on whenever I
    have the itch to start it, but finishing other parts of Xulux are
    a bit higher on the list for now, like expanding the number of widgets,
    refactoring the widgets, adding rule engines, adding scripting languages,
    creating the SWT gui layer and starting the work on ide integration
    for easier creation of applications.
