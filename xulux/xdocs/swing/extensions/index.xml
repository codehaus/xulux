<section name="Swing Extensions">
  <p>
    To make nyx work the way it does, a lot of times Swing components need to be extended to
    get some basic jobs done. Below a list of widgets that are extended, with links to the docs
    which explain why they were extended.

<section name="Extended Swing Components">
  <p>
    This section contains links to other pages, with topics 
    of the inner workings of swing nyx integration. Also
    extension points <b>specific</b> to swing will be addressed in some
    cases.
