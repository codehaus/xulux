  <p>
    Nyx supports swing. There are a couple of issues however with
    Swing that needed fixing for it to work the same way as the SWT part
    will work.
    This document explains what you can do to customize the things
    that nyx uses internally. This is btw done via properties that can be
    passed to the jvm (NOTE: it needs to be improved, since nyx should be 
    able to run perfectly without any jvm commandline parameters and still
    allowing to add those parameters).

    This section contains links to other pages, with topics 
    of the inner workings of swing nyx integration. Also
    extension points <b>specific</b> to swing will be addressed in some
    cases.
